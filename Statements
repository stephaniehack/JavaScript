JavaScript Programs
A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.
In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.
A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements.
In HTML, JavaScript programs are executed by the web browser.

JavaScript Statements
JavaScript statements are composed of:
Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.
This statement tells the browser to write "Hello Dolly." inside an HTML element with id=“demo”.
Most JavaScript programs contain many JavaScript statements.
The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are written.
JavaScript programs (and JavaScript statements) are often called JavaScript code.
Semicolons ;
Semicolons separate JavaScript statements.
Add a semicolon at the end of each executable statement:
let a, b, c;  // Declare 3 variables
a = 5;        // Assign the value 5 to a
b = 6;        // Assign the value 6 to b
c = a + b;    // Assign the sum of a and b to c


When separated by semicolons, multiple statements on one line are allowed:
a = 5; b = 6; c = a + b;


On the web, you might see examples without semicolons.
Ending statements with semicolon is not required, but highly recommended.
